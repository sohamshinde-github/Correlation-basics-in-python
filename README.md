Studied correlation between the truck load capacity and weight, distance travelled

- Used numpy correlation function to find whether relation is positive or negative between truck load and weight.
- Distance and cost per load ih positively correlated with correlation coefficient of 0.9042
- Leadtime and cost per load is negatively correlated with correlation coefficient of -0.0933
